                <img src="assets/images/cat.jpg" alt="cat sleeping">
                <p>In our urban and suburban houses whta should we do without cats?in our sitting or bedrooms,our liabraries, in our kitchen and storerooms, our farms,barns and rickyards,in our docks,our granaries, our ships, and our wharves, in our corn markets, meat markets, and other places too numerous to mention ,how useful they are! in our ships,however, the rsts oft set them at defiance; still they are of great service. </p>
                <p>How wonderfully patient is the cat when watching for rats or mice awaiting their ragress from their place od refuge or that which is their home!How well Shakespeare in pericies, Act iii., describes this keen attention of the cat to its natural prusuit!</p>
                <p class="indent">The cat eith eyne of burning coal, Now crouches from (before) the mouse's hole.</p>
                <p>A slight rustle, and the fugitive comes froth; a quick, sharp,resolute motion, and the cat has proved its usefulness. Let any one have a plague of rats and mice, as i once had, and let them be delivered thereform by cats, as  i was and mice, as is once had and let them be delivered therform by cats, as i was, and they eill have a lasting and kind regard for them</p>
